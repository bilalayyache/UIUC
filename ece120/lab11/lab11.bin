; Yichi Zhang, April 7th

; Register Table:
; R2: Store the value that picked from the memory
; R3: Pointer to point the address of the stored numbers.
; R4: A counter has initial value 10.
; R5: Store the sum of all values that are positive

0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here

1110 011 000110001; 	(x3100)R3 <-- PC + x0031	Initialize R3 to be the address that stores first value
0101 101 101 1 00000; 	(x3101)R5 <-- R5 AND x0000	Initialize R5 = 0 to be the sum of the positive numbers
0001 100 101 1 01010; 	(x3102)R4 <-- R5 + x000a	Initialize R4 to be the counter that start at decimal 10
0110 010 011 000000; 	(x3103)R2 <-- M[R3]		Load the current number to R2
0000 110 000000001; 	(x3104)if nz, PC <-- PC+1	If R2 is zero or negative, skip the addition
0001 101 101 0 00 010; 	(x3105)R5 <-- R5 + R2		Do the addition and store the value to R5
0001 011 011 1 00001; 	(x3106)R3 <-- R3 + 1		Increase the pointer by 1, get ready to get the next number
0001 100 100 1 11111; 	(x3107)R4 <-- R4 - 1		Decrease the counter by 1
0000 001 111111010; 	(x3108)if p, PC <-- PC-6	If the counter is still positive, go back the the begining of the loop
1111 0000 0010 0101; 	(x3109)halt			End of the program
