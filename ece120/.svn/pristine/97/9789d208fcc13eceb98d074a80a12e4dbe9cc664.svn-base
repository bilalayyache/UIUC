QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab10.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: 
First, the program will be stored at x3000. Second, it will clear the value of the R2 register by ANDing it with x00000. Third, it will ADD R2 with decimal value 12 and store this new value to R2. Last, the program is stopped by TRAP operation.

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 
By running only one instruction at a time, it is easy to find bugs by analysing the operations one by one.
