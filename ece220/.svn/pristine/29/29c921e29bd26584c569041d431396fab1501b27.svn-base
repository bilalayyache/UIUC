/*
 * Introductory paragraph
 * In this file, it contains three functions for the game of live.
 * First function is called countLiveNeighbor, which determines whether the current
   cell will be alive or not in next generation.
 * Second function is called updateBoard, which update the game board by using the
   first function to make necessary changes to the board.
 * Third function is called aliveStable, which check whether the board is stable or not.
   If the board is stable, it does not need to make any further changes to the board.

 * countLiveNeighbor
 * Inputs:
 * board: 1-D array of the current game board. 1 represents a live cell.
 * 0 represents a dead cell
 * boardRowSize: the number of rows on the game board.
 * boardColSize: the number of cols on the game board.
 * row: the row of the cell that needs to count alive neighbors.
 * col: the col of the cell that needs to count alive neighbors.
 * Output:
 * return the number of alive neighbors. There are at most eight neighbors.
 * Pay attention for the edge and corner cells, they have less neighbors.
